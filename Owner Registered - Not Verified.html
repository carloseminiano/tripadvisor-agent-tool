<h3>🔍 How to Verify Using Photo ID</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Owner_Registered_Not_Verified + Verification Method: Not_Verified</p>

<p>
When the OSC status says <strong>Owner_Registered_Not_Verified</strong> and the Verification method is <strong>Not_Verified</strong>, then the owner has already created an affiliation but has not completed the verification.
</p>

<p>
✅ <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Recommend the <strong>Photo ID Verification</strong>. It is the most secure method and usually takes only 1 minute.
</p>

<p>
🕒 <strong>Note:</strong> If it takes longer than 1 minute, advise phone contacts to wait. No need to mention this on email.
</p>

<p>
🔄 <strong>Other Info:</strong> Delayed verifications go to the Trust & Safety pending queue. Ask them to wait up to <strong>72 hours</strong> for a confirmation email.
